# Five Common Word Usage Mistakes

## 1. Toward, Not Towards

The preposition _towards_ is British usage; the US spelling is _toward_. Writing _towards_ is like writing _colour_ or _judgement_.

**Factoid:** Except for _backwards_ and _afterwards_, no preposition ending in _-ward_ takes a final _s_ in US usage.

## 2. And So: Pick One

_And_ is a conjunction; so is _so_. Except in dialogue between particular kinds of characters, you never need both conjunctions.

**Incorrect:** "He needed to eat, and so he bought food."

In 95% of cases like this, what you want to do is cut the _and_.

## 3. Comma + Conjunction Requires Two Independent Clauses

For a compound sentence to require a comma plus a conjunction, both its constituent clauses must be independent. An independent clause (a) has both a subject and a main verb, and (b) expresses a complete thought.

**Example:** In a sentence like "He ate all the food, and went back for more," you don't need both the comma and the _and_ because the second clause isn't independent.

## 4. Signal Words and Dependent Clauses

There are certain words whose appearance at the beginning of a clause renders that clause dependent. (They basically keep the clause from expressing a complete thought.) Examples include _since_, _while_, _because_, _although_, and _as_. You may have learned to call these kinds of words Signal Words or Temporal Adverbs in high school. They, too, affect the punctuation of a compound sentence.

The crucial question is whether the clause that starts with a Signal Word occurs first in the sentence or not.

**If it comes first, you need a comma:**

- "As the wave crashed down, the surfer fell."
- "While Bob ate all the food, Rhonda looked on in horror."

**If it comes second, you do not need a comma:**

- "The surfer fell as the wave crashed down."
- "Rhonda looked on in horror while Bob ate all the food."

## 5. The Tricky Case of "Because"

In real prose stylistics, the Signal Word thing can get a little tricky. _Because_ is a funny word, and sometimes you'll need a comma before its appearance in the second clause in order to keep your sentence from giving the wrong impression.

**Example:** Say Bob's been murdered; the question is whether Rhonda did it. Look at the following two sentences:

- a. "Rhonda didn't do it because she loved him."
- b. "Rhonda didn't do it, because she loved him."

Sentence **a**, which is grammatically standard, here really says that Rhonda _did_ kill Bob but that her reason for the murder wasn't love, i.e., that the reason Rhonda killed Bob was not her love for him.

Sentence **b** says that Rhonda did _not_ kill Bob and that the reason she didn't is that she loves him.

In 99% of cases, what someone'll be meaning to say is what **b** says. So, though nonstandard in the abstract, **b** can be _semantically_ correct, correct in a meaning-based context.
